# Video Hosting Backend Project

This repository contains a backend project for a video hosting platform similar to YouTube. The goal of this project is to learn and implement core backend concepts such as user authentication, video upload and streaming, data storage, and API design. It is currently under active development as part of my backend learning journey, with features being added step by step.
